# Mini-Statistics with List â€“ Receive grades and calculate average, highest and lowest grades.

# Output:
#  Average: 8.30
#  Highest: 10.0
#  Lowest: 6.8




# Description:
# Receives a list of grades and shows the average, highest, and lowest values.
# Uses:
# - Lists with float values
# - sum(), max(), min() for calculations
# - Function to separate logic
# - f-strings with formatting for better output (e.g., {:.2f})
