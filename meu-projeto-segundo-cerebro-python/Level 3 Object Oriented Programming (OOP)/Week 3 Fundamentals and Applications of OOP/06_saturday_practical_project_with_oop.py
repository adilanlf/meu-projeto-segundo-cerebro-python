# --- Test the system ---

# Create accounts

alice = SavingsAccount("Alice", 200)                     # Savings account

# Operations
john.deposit(50)                                         # Deposit to John's account
john.withdraw(30)                                        # Withdraw from John's account  (with fee)
alice.apply_interest()                                   # Apply interest to Alice's account

print(john)                                              # Print John's account info
print(alice)                                             # Print Alice's account info

# Output:

# Withdrawn 30 + fee 5. New balance: 115
# Interest of 4.0 applied. New balance: 204.0
# Deposit successful. New balance: 254.0
# Transferred 50 to Alice
# John | Balance: 65
# Alice | Balance: 254.0
